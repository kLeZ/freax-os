# Our philosophy #
## Briefly ##
We think that there are many most-valuable distributions out there, some of them pointing on reliability or stability where others point on usability and productivity. We want to catch all these requirements and make a more omni-comprehensive distribution. We want to make easy the easy things and doable those things that generally are very hard.

# Concepts #
Our goal is to make a distribution that will be:
  * **Standard** - we want to follow all the [Linux Standard Base (LSB)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base) reasonable standards, to make FreaXOS the more standards compliant distribution ever made
  * **Stable** - for the system administrator who don't want to deal with inconsistencies and for those users interested in a system that just works
  * **User-friendly** - for those inexperienced users who want to try a free OS, but even for those experts who need a productivity-friendly system where to think only of what's most important in all-days usage
  * **KISS** - A system that is simple to configure, simple to think, simple to repair, simple to use (_[KISS Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)_)
  * **Updated By Needs** - A system that leaves the choice to which packages are good for someone's installation, choosing which versions are useful for anyone's needs. This means most updated (but stable) packages for desktop users, most updated (trunk-dev) packages for testers or developers, and old stable secure packages for system administrators who rely on stability and security.
  * **Secure** - A system that is secure for a normal user but can be unbreakable for the system administrator who needs, for example, a perimeter server between a LAN segment and the Internet or a company gateway
  * **GNU** - A system that can fit the GNU specifications and the [FLOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#FLOSS) philosophy of free `[`_as in freedom_`]` software with an eye regarding projects that want to implement a libre alternative to some popular proprietary softwares (such as flash player `[`replaced with  [gnash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnash)`]` or java `[`replaced with [OpenJDK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK)`]`)
  * **Gtk+ free** - A system that will be free from Gtk+ applications, because we think that they are hierarchy-anarchic. Some Gtk+ apps like Firefox, Chromium, Eclipse, GIMP, Pidgin will be available, but they will be placed in their own _single_ path in the /usr subhierarchy.
