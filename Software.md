# Introduction #

This page describes our software selection for the base system, from the boot
loader to the graphical interface.  Some times it could happen that we will
refer to a software by its super project (such as KDE, instead of every piece
of the KDE platform). Anyway we will list in detail all the packages of that
super package, a so called _pattern_ (you can find a pattern in the list
because it appears bold and italic), indented under its pattern.
